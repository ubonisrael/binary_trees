0x1D. C - Binary trees (C, Group project, Algorithm, Data structure)


The repository contains solutions to the Binary Trees project at ALX Software Engineering.
The goal of this to project is to:
- understand what a binary tree is
- understand the difference between a binary tree and a binary search tree
- understand the possible gains in terms of time complexity to linked lists
- understand what the depth, height, size of a binary tree are
- understand the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- undestand what a complete, full, perfect and a balanced binary tree is
